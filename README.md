# Jordanian Social Security Pension Calculator (Beta) 🇯🇴⚙️

## 📌 Overview
A robust, purely client-side web application designed to simulate and calculate pension eligibility according to both the current (2014) Jordanian Social Security Law and the newly proposed draft amendments. The tool provides a comprehensive report comparing retirement conditions and estimates lump-sum compensation for users who do not meet the minimum pension requirements.

## ✨ Key Features
* **Dual Calculation Logic:** Dynamically calculates required contributions based on continuous public sector service (using appointment dates) or flexible private sector rules (starting from age 22).
* **Logical Firewall & QA Tested:** Built with strict input validation to prevent edge-case vulnerabilities, including "time-traveling" dates, underage employment (under 16), negative salaries, and illogical target ages.
* **Dynamic Date Generation:** Automatically populates valid birth and appointment years based on the current system year, ensuring long-term code sustainability without manual updates.
* **Responsive UI/UX:** A clean, mobile-friendly interface designed with CSS grid and flexbox, featuring print-ready CSS for generating official-looking reports.
* **Content Protection:** Includes basic client-side protections against text selection and right-click inspections to deter casual source-code copying.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **HTML5:** Semantic structuring.
* **CSS3:** Custom styling, responsive design, and print media queries.
* **Vanilla JavaScript:** Core logic, DOM manipulation, and dynamic validations without reliance on heavy external libraries.
* **FontAwesome:** For intuitive UI icons.
* **Google Analytics:** Integrated for real-time traffic and engagement tracking.

## ⚠️ Legal Disclaimer
This tool is strictly a **"Beta and Exploratory"** model programmed based on the recent draft amendments to the Social Security Law. The results generated are for preliminary evaluation purposes only and do not constitute legal grounds or official decisions, as the amendments have not yet been officially enacted.
